Following this, partners participated in an icebreaker exercise and a fun quiz competition about the partnering regions and their home cities. The team then presented and discussed the program specifics, detailing how project members can successfully collaborate through project reporting and the use of the Interreg Portal, while also outlining the financial rules and the internal reporting system. Following a short coffee break, the presentation continued with a detailed explanation of project indicators and monitoring, communication activities, and the to-do list for the first period. After a Q&A session, the partners had the opportunity to explore the sights of Hévíz and its unique thermal lake.</b></p>
